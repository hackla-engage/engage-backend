# Pseudocode
1. Make a file for yourself.
2. Identify what steps you feel are good to gather the information we need
    * Remember:
        * Tags are supposed to be for the user, so they must be something they would identify with
        * Refer to the 6 (I can only find 5) concepts that SM uses: "Community", "Place", "Learning", "Health", "Economic opportunity"... was the 6th "Responsive government?"
3. push that information here
4. Next week we'll review them together and see what sticks
